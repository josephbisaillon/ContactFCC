IMPORTANT!
If you wish to run it, you must have the ContactInfo.csv file in the same directory as the .exe.


An open source project to create an easy way to send the same email to all FCC leadership.

Currently in prototype, it can successfully send emails to all the leadership.
Hoping to branch this project into an online application instead of a Windows Forms Application.
Got the idea from the Contact Congress Project, but wanted to make a working prototype and not just yaml files. Also, the .csv file included needs to be moved into the same folder as the .exe when it is run.

Any and all suggestions welcome!
