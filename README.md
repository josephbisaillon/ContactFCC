ContactFCC
==========

An open source project to create an easy way to send the same email to all FCC leadership.

+ Currently in prototype, it can successfully send emails to all the leadership. 
+ ASP.net version of the application

Got the idea from the Contact Congress Project, but wanted to make a working prototype and not just yaml files.
Also, the .csv file included needs to be moved into the same folder as the .exe when it is run. 

==========
Any and all suggestions welcome!
